# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-with-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Network
In this project, a deep convolutional model is built based on the VGG16 model. 
Besides, a GAN model including a generator and a discriminator is used. After trained by the original dataset, the generator is used to generated extra training images to feed into the VGG16 model. 
The data setg we used is from Kaggle contest.
